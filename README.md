# React eSports

Hello there! This a portfolio project I made that focuses on building a slick, modern landing page for an eSports website.

The primary objective with this portfolio piece is to demonstrate my React and Tailwind skills. I would normally abstract elements such as ![HeroBanner.jsx](https://github.com/ASproson/react-esports/blob/main/src/components/HeroBanner.jsx) into styled components that get called in sequence, but I thought it was better from a presentational point of view to keep the really hardcore Tailwind all in one place.

You can view the live deployment [here](https://asproson.github.io/react-esports/)

## Tech Used

- React
- React Icons
- Tailwind CSS

## Installation

> git clone https://github.com/ASproson/react-esports.git
